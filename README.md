##Concept


On the screen, random images that represent the people and objects behidn the physical internet appear randomly and rapidly.

##Design and schematic

The installation hosted three books with three flex sensors, but could be expanded to as many books as you have analog pins to read on your board. 

### The board
<img src="documentation/fritzing.jpg" width="500px"/>


### The flex sensor 

The flex sensor is a resistor, and as it bends, it's resistance changes. On the ground side, there are two outputs. The first is a line from the sensor's ground pin into the analog input on the Photon. Second, we place a 22K resistor between the sensor's ground pin and the ground track of the breadboard. Electrical current flows in the path of least resistance. The 22K resistor is a big resistor value, and it effectively serves as a great big wall that forces the current to flow to the analog pin instead. <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/flex-sensor-hookup-guide">The documentation suggests</a> any resistor value between 10K and 100K. 

The documentation was really helpful! It's important to only bend the flex sensors in a certain direction, and to avoid bending them at their weak bases.

For the installation, I needed to hide the breadboard, so I soldered a foot of hookup wire to the ends of the flex sensors.

### The books

To design the books, I created screenshots of Buzzfeed articles, and used Adobe InDesign to layout the book spreads. I used the imposition features of Indesign to print the booklets. 

I made the covers out of reclaimed Amazon boxes. I taped the soldered flex sensor inside the books cover, and I was careful to place the tape over the weak base of the sensor. The sensors were only taped down on *one* side. I also taped the wiring and bent it back around, so the wires would pierce the cover's spine. All of the circuitry is on one side of the of the cover, and I covered this up with a sheet of cardstock. This also served as a cover liner. I also glued a sheet of cardstock to the other side of the cover, and slid the the loose, untaped side of the flex sensor underneath the cardstock lining on this side. It was important to avoid taping the sensor down on both sides, because the sensor needed some flexible space to move depending on if the book is open (flat) or closed (bent). 

I tried to avoid buying any materials for this project, but I did buy one thing from Amazon: a bookmaking kit. It's hard to sew a book together without a good needle! After I got the sensors into the covers and glued down the cover lining, I used the bookmaking kit and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWHkY5jOoqM">this saddle stitching tutorial</a> to sew the books together with waxed thread.


### All that cardboard

Many people were happy to donate their Amazon boxes to me for this project. 




##Code

This installation depends on OSC to send a message from the Photon to the Processing sketch over wifi. Below I annotate both the Photon code and the Processing sketch, and explain how to set up OSC.  


###Photon code

In the Photon code, we start by importing the SimpleOSC library.  Make sure to install this via Particle Library installer, copy/paste won't work. 

    This #include statement was automatically added by the Particle IDE.
    #include <simple-OSC.h>
  
Then we set up the OSC variables, which we will use to send the OSC message, and analog pins, where we will grab the data from the sensors.   

    UDP udp;
    IPAddress outIp(XX,XXX,XX,XXX); // CHANGE THIS BASED ON YOUR NETWORK (FIND IP IN NETWORK SETTINGS)
    unsigned int outPort = 1234; // MATCH THIS TO PORT # IN PROCESSING
    unsigned int inPort = 8001;

    /* OSC VARIABLES */
    float flexValue0;
    float flexValue1;
    float flexValue2;


    /* FLEX SENSOR */
    int flexSensorPin0 = A0; //analog pin 0
    int flexSensorPin1 = A1; //analog pin 1
    int flexSensorPin2 = A2; //analog pin 2

In the setup function, set up OSC and serial communication. 

    void setup(){
    
        /* OSC */
        Serial.begin(115200); // faster data rate
        udp.begin(inPort); //necessary even for sending only
        Serial.println("");
        Serial.println("WiFi connected");
        IPAddress ip = WiFi.localIP();

    }

In the loop, pass the sensor information into variables, and use those variables to create the OSC message. The OSC message will be an array of 3 float values. 


    void loop(){

        flexValue0 = analogRead(flexSensorPin0);
        flexValue1 = analogRead(flexSensorPin1);
        flexValue2 = analogRead(flexSensorPin2);
    
        /* OSC */
    
        // set up the message
        OSCMessage outMessage("/photon");

		// add message 1x1
        outMessage.addFloat(flexValue0);
        outMessage.addFloat(flexValue1);
        outMessage.addFloat(flexValue2);
 
    
        // finish the message
        outMessage.send(udp,outIp,outPort);
}

###Processing code

In Processing, we set up OSC and create our variables:



    import netP5.*;
    import oscP5.*;

    OscP5 oscP5;


    /* OSC VARIABLES */
    float flexValue0;
    float openThreshold0 = 1000; // calibrate these numbers based on sensor readings

    float flexValue1;
    float openThreshold1 = 400; 

    float flexValue2;
    float openThreshold2 = 1100; 


    /* IMAGES TO SHOW */
    int counter = 20; // number of images, would be cooler if it could count the folder
    PImage[] imgs = new PImage[counter]; // declary the array, create 20 spots



In the set up function, set up OSC and load the images. Change the sketch's frame rate to adjust the speed of the photo playback:

    void setup() {
    size(1680, 1025);
    background(0);
    frameRate(18);

    oscP5 = new OscP5(this, 1234);

    // load all the images - MUST BE NAMED photo*.jpg and be in sketch > data folder
    for (int i = 1; i < counter; i++) {
        imgs[i] = loadImage("photo" + i + ".jpg");
    	}
    }

Receive the Photon's OSC message and pass it into our Processing variables:

    void oscEvent(OscMessage theOscMessage) {
     if (theOscMessage.checkAddrPattern("/photon")==true) {
        flexValue0 = theOscMessage.get(0).floatValue();
        flexValue1 = theOscMessage.get(1).floatValue();
        flexValue2 = theOscMessage.get(2).floatValue();

        return;
      }
    }

Set up a function to draw the images:

    void imageDrawer() {
      // get a random number between 0 and counter 
      float randomIndexFloat = random(1, counter);
      int randomIndex = int(randomIndexFloat);
      image(imgs[randomIndex], 0, 0); // draw the default image
    }

And we use the float data to trigger the image drawing function at a specific threshold:

    void draw() {
        if (flexValue0 > openThreshold0 || flexValue1 > openThreshold1 || flexValue2 >         openThreshold2) {
            imageDrawer();
        } else {
            background(0);
        }
    }
